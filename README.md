# My Portfolio Site

Pour a glass and settle in—this is my corner of the internet, crafted with the same care I bring to products, people, and ideas. It’s clean, fast, and intentional. No fluff, just signal.

Here you’ll find:
- Work that blends business analysis, data storytelling, and product thinking
- Projects like SonusShare—because good ideas deserve good execution
- Writing that explains complex things simply

The stack? React, Vite, Tailwind—lightweight and modern, built for speed and clarity. The goal is simple: communicate who I am and what I build, without getting in the way.

If you’re here to collaborate, you’re in good company. If you’re here to browse, enjoy the tour. And if you’re here with a glass of wine—cheers, we’ll get along just fine.
